## Wave, Wind, and Solar energy in Oahu!

This was some work I did over the summer of 2023 as a SULI intern with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. It involves some analysis of wind/wave resource files to estimate the available power, and see how well it works for renewables grid integration.

The project was short so the files are somewhat disorganized, but hopefully the documentation at the start of each file should guide one through what I'm up to.
